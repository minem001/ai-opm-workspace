### Naming conventions

| Type | Format | Example | Location |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| Daily note | `YYYY-MM-DD.md` | `2026-02-14.md` | `journals/2026/02-February/` |
| Work note | `YYYY-MM-DD - Title.md` | `2026-02-14 - Decision - API scope.md` | `Loose Notes/Work/` |
| Meeting note | `YYYY-MM-DD - Meeting description.md` | `2026-02-14 - Customer sync.md` | `Meetings/2026/02-February/` |
| Inbox file | anything | `2026-02-14 - braindump.md` | `Inbox/` |
| Archived raw file | `[original-filename]-raw.md` | `2026-02-14 - Customer sync-raw.md` | `Archive/[type] Archive/` |
| Thought log | `YYYY-MM.md` | `2026-03.md` | `Thoughts/` |
| Idea file | `IDEA-XXX - Title.md` | `IDEA-001 - OPM Skill for Customer Use Cases.md` | `Ideas/` |
| Task file | `T-NNN - Title.md` | `T-001 - Ship API docs.md` | `Tasks/` |

### Task Tracking System

**Storage**: Active task files in `Tasks/`, archived (done/cancelled) in `Tasks/Archive/YYYY/MM-Month/`, generated dashboard in `Dashboard/Tasks.md`

**Statuses**: `inbox` ↔ `backlog` → `in-progress` → `done` | `blocked` (needs reason) | `cancelled` (needs reason) | any state → `inbox` (deprioritize)

**Priority levels**: P1 (critical, max 1) → P2 (high, max 2) → P3 (medium) → P4 (low) → P5 (optional)

**Task fields**: id (auto), status, priority, owner (default: Mike Nemeth), deadline, source (wikilink), type (task/goal), created date, changelog

**Dashboard** (`Dashboard/Tasks.md`): Auto-generated view of active tasks with checkboxes. Check a box in Obsidian to mark done — next task-aware skill run syncs the change.

**Skills**: `/task` (create, update, query) | `/task-review` (ad-hoc triage and prioritization)

### Tags
- `DailyNote` - Daily journal entries
- `LooseNotes` - General notes
- `MeetingNotes` - Meeting records
- `Idea` - Idea files in `Ideas/`
<!-- Add your own tags: people tags (#PersonName), customer tags (#CustomerName), etc. -->

## Task Cadence

| Frequency | Tasks | Skills to use |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Daily** | Morning planning, meeting notes, decisions, communications | `/today`, `/meeting`, `/decision`, `/communicate` |
| **Ad-hoc** | Task review, triage inbox, reprioritize | `/task-review` |
| **Monthly** | Reflection, progress review | Custom agent (build your own) |

---

## People & Communication Context

**Reference**: `Dashboard/people-profiles.md` for communication preferences and working styles of key stakeholders.

**Communication tone guidance**:
- **Engineering teams**: Technical, precise, context-rich, collaborative — lead with the problem and constraints
- **Leadership / Executives**: Strategic, metrics-driven, concise, aligned with company goals
- **Customers / External**: Professional, benefits-focused, clear ROI, no internal jargon

**Slack markdown formatting**:
- **Bold**: Use `*text*` (single asterisk), NOT `**text**`
- **Bullets**: Use `-` for bullets
- **Emoji**: Use `:emoji_name:` format

## How AI Should Work with This Vault

### Do
- When analyzing journals, look for **patterns across days**, not individual entries
- Be specific and direct - reference concrete notes and patterns
- When creating notes, follow existing naming conventions and use appropriate templates
- Link new notes in today's journal (`journals/YYYY/MM-Month/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- When creating work notes, save in `Loose Notes/Work/` and link from daily note
- **Always archive raw source files before processing** — meeting notes go to `Archive/Meetings Archive/`, inbox files go to `Archive/Notes Archive/`
- When processing content from `Inbox/`, move the original to `Archive/Notes Archive/` after creating the structured output
- **Always log workspace changes to `workspace_changelog.md`** — any time you create/rename/delete folders or files, add/update skills, or change conventions in `CLAUDE.md` or `copilot-instructions.md`, append a dated entry. Detail level: what was fixed, what was created, what was updated (with file paths and a description of what changed).

### Don't
- Don't give generic productivity advice - be specific to documented patterns
- Don't create files outside the established folder structure
- Don't assume empty daily note fields mean a bad day
- Don't write to external repositories from this vault

---

## Daily Notes Structure

Daily notes follow the template in `templates/daily-note.md`:

**Sections**:
- **Today**: Mood, energy, focus (max 3 items), tasks
- **Notes**: Links to meeting notes and loose notes created that day
- **End of Day**: What was completed, what to start with tomorrow

**Frontmatter**: Includes `energy` and `mood` fields for quantitative tracking.

---

## Important Patterns

### Overplanning tendency
**Pattern**: Many PMs plan too many tasks for the week, leading to disappointment.
**Solution**: When running weekly planning, if the list has more than 5-7 P-tasks or last week's completion rate was low, **challenge and ask to prioritize**. Remind: "Which 3-5 tasks are truly critical?"

### Meeting note enrichment
**Pattern**: Raw meeting notes need structure, context links, and action items extracted.
**Solution**: `/meeting` skill creates structured notes with decisions, action items, and links to relevant context.

### Decision documentation
**Pattern**: Decisions happen in Slack or meetings but aren't always documented.
**Solution**: `/decision` skill creates structured decision notes, links them in the daily journal.

### Focus item strikethrough on completion
**Pattern**: When a task is marked as done and appears in the daily note's "My focus today" section, the focus item should be visually marked as complete.
**Solution**: Wrap the completed focus item text in `~~strikethrough~~` so it's clearly done at a glance. See the **Focus Item Strikethrough** section in the task skill for matching and formatting rules.
